# Reputon 

[rfc7070](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7070)
[7072](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7072)

## Abstract

This is a preliminary attempt at establishing a multi-faceted "reputation"
that can asset the probability that you are not dealing with a "fradulent" 
contract. 

## Overview: Reputation Interchange

`(reputon)` schema + `(repute)` reputation query protocol = `[replet]`


### Reputation Query Protocol

> source, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7072

 For example, given the following template:

```curl
http://{service}/{application}/{subject}/{assertion}
```

 unambigously means,

```curl
http://{service}/{application}/{subject}/{assertion}/a={a}/b={b}
```

### By fradulent we mean "not pertaining to the intended contract address owner"

This is *not* an attempt to offer a *consumer reports* style review of the 
contract address in question, rather its to prevent a "man in the middle" or
otherwise deceptive practice of diverting a user from interacting wit the 
**de facto** legitmate contract.

The additional API functions are either provided by [us](https://github.com/freight-trust), 
JSON RPC for [conforming EVM clients](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu), 3rd 
party data providers like [amberdata](https://amberdata.io) or sites like
[defipulse.com](https://defipulse.com).

## Reputon RFC

> source: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7070

   A reputon expressed in JSON is a set of key-value pairs, where the
   keys are the names of particular attributes that comprise a reputon
   (as listed above, or as provided with specific applications), and
   values are the content associated with those keys.  The set of keys
   that make up a reputon within a given application are known as that
   application's "response set".

   A reputon object typically contains a reply corresponding to the
   assertion for which a client made a specific request.  For example, a
   client asking for assertion "sends-spam" about domain "example.com"
   would expect a reply consisting of a reputon making a "sends-spam"
   assertion about "example.com" and nothing more.  If a client makes a
   request about a subject but does not specify an assertion of
   interest, the server can return reputons about any assertion for
   which it has data; in effect, the client has asked for any available
   information about the subject.  A client that receives an irrelevant
   reputon simply ignores it.

   An empty reputon is an acknowledgment by the server that the request
   has been received, and serves as a positive indication that the
   server does not have the information requested.  This is semantically
   equivalent to returning a reputon with a "sample-size" of zero.


## Terms

OBJECT:  a JSON object, defined in Section 2.2 of [JSON]

MEMBER:  a member of a JSON object, defined in Section 2.2 of [JSON]

MEMBER-NAME:  the name of a MEMBER, defined as a "string" in
      Section 2.2 of [JSON]

MEMBER-VALUE:  the value of a MEMBER, defined as a "value" in
      Section 2.2 of [JSON]

ARRAY:  an array, defined in Section 2.3 of [JSON]

ARRAY-VALUE:  an element of an ARRAY, defined in Section 2.3 of
      [JSON]

   NUMBER:  a "number" as defined in Section 2.4 of [JSON]

   INTEGER:  an "integer" as defined in Section 2.4 of [JSON]

   STRING:  a "string" as defined in Section 2.5 of [JSON]

## Structure

reputation-object:  an OBJECT containing a MEMBER reputation-context
      and a MEMBER reputon-list

reputation-context:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "application" and
      MEMBER-VALUE a STRING (see Section 3)

reputon-list:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "reputons" and MEMBER-VALUE
      a reputon-array

reputon-array:  an ARRAY, where each ARRAY-VALUE is a reputon

reputon:  an OBJECT, where each MEMBER is a reputon-element

reputon-element:  one of the following, defined below: rater-value,
      assertion-value, rated-value, rating-value, conf-value, normal-
      value, sample-value, gen-value, expire-value, ext-value; note the
      following:

      *  The order of reputon-element members is not significant.

      *  A specific reputon-element MUST NOT appear more than once.

      *  rater-value, assertion-value, rated-value, and rating-value are
         REQUIRED.

rater-value:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "rater" and MEMBER-VALUE a
      STRING (see "rater" in Section 3.1)

assertion-value:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "assertion" and MEMBER-
      VALUE a STRING (see "assertion" in Section 3.1)

rated-value:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "rated" and MEMBER-VALUE a
      STRING (see "rated" in Section 3.1)
